## [Project-1 -> Ecommerce Performance Analysis](https://github.com/AIK-01/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Project-1%20-%3E%20Ecommerce%20Performance%20Analysis#project-overview)
#### "The Look" is an e-commerce company that began its operations in **2018**, specializing in various clothing and accessories for both men and women. This project was initiated at the request of the company owner to conduct a thorough analysis of the store's performance. The primary goals of this analysis are to determine the overall business growth rate and to identify any specific areas that the operating team should focus on.

#### This report is based on all historical data from **2019** through **2025**. I have analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer acquisition, sales volume, sales revenue, and average order value (AOV). The aim is to understand the company's performance, identify opportunities for improvement, and generate more revenue and profit. In addition, I will provide recommendations for the data team to improve data quality, which will help the company make better, more informed decisions in the future.
